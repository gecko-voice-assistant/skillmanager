# Skillmanager

This repository includes the so-called 'Skillmanager' of the G.E.C.K.O. project.  
This represents the backend of the skillsystem and should not be run separately.  
To install and use the complete system, you should have a look at our [project website](https://gecko-voice-assistant.github.io/gecko/).  
There you will also find step-by-step [instruction for the installation](https://gecko-voice-assistant.github.io/gecko/docs/installation/).  
If you find any bugs, see how to report them [here](https://gecko-voice-assistant.github.io/gecko/docs/contributing/how-to/#how-to-file-an-issue).
